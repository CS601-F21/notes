Project 2 Interactive Grading Guide
===================================

This guide describes the interactive grading process for Project 2.

**Deadline is 9:55am**: The deadline for this project is *9:55am* on October 7th. Even if your interactive grading appointment takes place after this time you will be graded on the solution that is github at the deadline.

## Sign up for a grading slot with the Instructor

Students who are not working in a team must use this link to sign up for their 20-minute slot:

Students who are working in a team must have one member of the team use this link to sign up for their 30-minute slot:

All sessions will take place at the class Zoom link:

Meeting ID: 846 4066 6307


At your scheduled time you will be invited into the Instructor breakout room.

Individual lots are only 20 minutes long; team slots are 30 minutes long. *Make sure you arrive on time to your scheduled slot. If you miss your session you may get a 0 for functionality.*

*Make sure you are prepared. If you are not prepared to execute your solution and/or cannot get it running during your slot you may get a 0 for functionality.* 

## *Arrive on time to your scheduled slot!*

It is **very** important that you arrive on time to the slot that you have scheduled. There will not be an opportunity to reschedule.

## Be prepared to demonstrate your solution from the terminal

You will be asked to execute your solution from the terminal using the project2.jar file you have submitted. Failure to do so may result in a score of 0. 

## Grading Script

During interactive grading you will be asked to do the following:

### Program Demonstration
You  will be asked to do the following:

**SyncOrdered - Part 1**

- Execute the Test Application using your Part 1 solution and the `SynchronousOrderedDispatchBroker`. 
- Clearly demonstrate the time required for your program to run to completion.
- Clearly demonstrate the size (either in MB or number of lines) for each output file.

**AsyncUnordered - Part 1**

- Execute the Test Application using your Part 1 solution and the `AsynchronousUnorderedDispatchBroker`. 
- Clearly demonstrate the time required for your program to run to completion.
- Clearly demonstrate the size (either in MB or number of lines) for each output file. This size must match the size of the output files for SyncOrdered.

**AsyncOrdered - Part 1**

- Execute the Test Application using your Part 1 solution and the `AsynchronousOrderedDispatchBroker`. 
- Clearly demonstrate the time required for your program to run to completion.
- Clearly demonstrate the size (either in MB or number of lines) for each output file. This size must match the size of the output files for SyncOrdered and AsyncUnordered.

**Timing Explanation**

- Describe *why* you believe you saw the relative timings you did and the tests you ran or other process you used to develop your explanation.

**Code Review - Part 1**

- Explain any Part 1 code the instructor requests to discuss.

**Part 2**

- Demonstrate your Part 2 solution.

**Code Review - Part 2**

- Explain any Part 2 code the instructor requests to discuss.

## Final Grading

You will not be assigned a final grade at the end of the interactive grading session. An instructor or TA will conduct a thorough review of your solution and assign a score for each of the Design elements described in the assignment.
