Project 1 Resubmission Guide
============================

This guide describes the requirements for resubmitting Project 1.

### Solutions that passed all functionality tests
If you earned the full score for all `Error Conditions` and `Functionality` criteria you may choose to use one of your two resubmission opportunities. You may also, **instead**, choose to do the [Peer Code Review](https://github.com/CS601-F21/notes/blob/main/admin/extracredit.md) for up to 3 points of extra credit. My advice: if your score was more than 90 you should do the extra credit and save your resubmissions for the next projects. Requirements for resubmission are described below. Note, if you passed all `Error Conditions` and `Functionality` criteria then you are eligible to get 100 on your submission.

### Solutions that did not pass all functionality tests
**For this project only** I will allow you to use one of your two resubmissions *even if you did not pass all tests in the `Error Conditions` and `Functionality` criteria*. If you choose this option you must follow the requirements described below. In addition, your final grade will have a penalty of 10 points or the number of points lost on the `Error Conditions` and `Functionality` criteria, whichever is less. If, for example, you lost 20 points on `Error Conditions` and `Functionality` then 10 points will be deducted from your final grade. If you lost only 5 points in total on `Error Conditions` and `Functionality` then 5 points will be deducted from your final grade. 

### Resubmission requirements
1. Use the following link to sign up for a code review appointment: [Project 1 Code Review](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UU9HWXNKcEM3V0pWfGRlZmF1bHR8YjJhZjVkZDAzZjE4NjQ2MGQ0N2RhMjE2Mzg2NWQ3MGE) Appointments slots are limited. Appointments must be *scheduled* by 5pm on Monday, 9/20, and *appointments must be completed by Friday, 9/24.* Requests to schedule after 5pm on Monday will be declined.
2. Use [Sami's Office Hour link](https://usfca.zoom.us/j/81328665253?pwd=dUlVN21VNEQ0NVJ3WWtYaGZmSjJvdz09) to meet with her for your 20-minute code review. During this appointment, she will provide you with feedback on your solution. 
3. Modify your solution to address all issues discussed during your code review. Issues that are not adequately addressed will result in a deduction from your final grade.
4. No later than **Saturday, 10/2/2021**, **create a [github pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)** to notify Sami that you are ready for her to grade your revised solution.

If you choose to resubmit Project 1, you are advised to carefully consider how to manage your time to ensure that you do not get behind with Project 2.
