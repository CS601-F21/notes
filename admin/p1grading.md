Project 1 Interactive Grading Guide
===================================

This guide describes the interactive grading process for Project 1.

**Deadline is 9:55am**: The deadline for this project is *9:55am* on September 16th. Even if your interactive grading appointment takes place after this time you will be graded on the solution that is github at the deadline.

## Sign up for a grading slot with an instructor or TA

Link TBA.

All sessions will take place via Zoom: 
[https://usfca.zoom.us/j/85869945964](https://usfca.zoom.us/j/85869945964).

All graders will use the same Zoom meeting. At your scheduled time you will be assigned to a breakout room with your assigned grader.

Slots are only 20 minutes long. *Make sure you arrive on time to your scheduled slot. If you miss your session you may get a 0 for functionality.*

*Make sure you are prepared. If you are not prepared to execute your solution and/or cannot get it running during your slot you may get a 0 for functionality.* 

## *Arrive on time to your scheduled slot!*

It is **very** important that you arrive on time to the slot that you have scheduled. There will not be an opportunity to reschedule.


## Be prepared to demonstrate your solution from the terminal

You will be asked to execute your solution from the terminal using the project1.jar file you have submitted. Failure to do so may result in a score of 0. 

## Grading Script

During interactive grading you will be asked to do the following:

### Program Demonstration
1. *Program Execution:* You will be asked to execute your program given several inputs. Some inputs will be valid and should result in a program that executes correctly. Some inputs will be invalid, and your solution should gracefully handle the error condition and exit the program.
2. *Search Operations:* You will be asked to demonstrate the output of your solution for several search queries. Your solution must produce the correct results in the expected order.
3. *Error Conditions:* You will be asked to demonstrate the output of your solution under several error conditions, for example missing query terms. Your solution should gracefully handle all error conditions.

### Code Review

You will be asked to discuss your code. The grader will direct you to a specific portion of your code and may ask you to explain the code or justify the design. 

## Final Grading

You will not be assigned a final grade at the end of the interactive grading session. An instructor or TA will conduct a thorough review of your solution and assign a score for each of the Design elements described in the assignment.
