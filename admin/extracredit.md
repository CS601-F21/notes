Extra Credit Opportunities
==========================


## Side Project Video

### Due - October 21, 2021

This extra credit opportunity is valid only until 10/21/2021.

**For completing this exercise you will earn up to one point toward the Labs, Quizzes, In-Class Exercises, Participation portion of your grade.** This essentially allows you to make up one in-class assignment.

To earn credit for this exercise, record a short video of *five minutes* or less describing your side project. Post a link to the video in the #side-project channel of the class Slack workspace.

Your video should, at minimum, describe the overall idea, the planned functionality of your project, and any technologies you will use. You may demonstrate any portion of your solution you have already completed.

## Peer Code Review

### Due - December 8, 2021

This extra credit opportunity is valid only until 12/8/2021.

**For completing this exercise you will earn up to three additional points toward the project for which you completed the exercise. You may complete this exercise for up to *two* of your projects *after you have received your project grade*.**

**This exercise may only be completed for a project that both participants choose *not* to resubmit.** See Project Resubmission on the syllabus for guidelines on resubmitting projects. 

To earn credit for this exercise, choose a classmate to be your code review partner for one of your projects. Again, make sure that neither partner plans to exercise the Project Resubmission option for the project. 

Each student will provide a peer code review to their partner. You are encouraged to use the internet as a resource to learn about peer code review. Your review may include design suggestions, comments on code that is incorrect or could be improved, and/or comments on incorrect Java style. You may also comment on aspects of the solution that you find particularly well designed.

Your comments must be provided in github. You may grant your partner access to your repository *after you have received your grade*. Your comments will either be provided as Issues or as comments made directly in the code. To earn credit, your comments must be substantial. Comments that I cannot see in github or that are superficial and do not provide substantive feedback will not earn credit.

Once both partners have completed their review, send me message on Slack and I will review and grade your exercise.
